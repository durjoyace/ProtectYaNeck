# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

ProtectYaNeck ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Summary

**TL;DR: We built a privacy tool, so we take privacy seriously.**

- Agreement text is analyzed locally in your browser — we never see it
- We don't sell your data. Period.
- Anonymous analytics help us improve (you can opt out)
- No account required for free tier

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information We DON'T Collect

- **Agreement content**: The text of Terms of Service, Privacy Policies, and other agreements you scan is processed entirely within your browser. We never receive, store, or have access to this content.
- **Browsing history**: We don't track which websites you visit.
- **Personal identifiers**: Free tier requires no account, email, or personal information.

### 1.2 Information We DO Collect

**Local Storage (on your device only):**
- Scan usage count (to enforce free tier limits)
- Your settings and preferences
- Whitelisted domains
- Scan history (stored locally, not sent to us)

**Anonymous Analytics (opt-out available):**
If you don't opt out, we collect anonymized usage data:
- Extension installed/activated events
- Number of scans performed (not content or URLs)
- Risk categories detected (aggregate, not specific)
- Error reports (to fix bugs)

This data contains no personal identifiers and cannot be linked back to you.

**Paid Subscribers:**
If you upgrade to a paid subscription:
- Email address (for account management)
- Payment information (processed securely by Stripe — we never see your card number)
- License key

**Lawyer Referral Requests:**
If you voluntarily submit a "Need a Lawyer?" request:
- Name and contact information you provide
- The concern you describe
- Page URL (if you choose to include it)

This information is shared with our legal partner network to connect you with appropriate assistance.
