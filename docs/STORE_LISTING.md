## Extension Name
**ProtectYaNeck - Legal Agreement Scanner**

## Short Description (132 characters max)
Scans Terms of Service & Privacy Policies in real-time. See what you're really agreeing to before you click "Accept."

## Detailed Description

**Stop signing away your rights.**

Every day, you click "I Agree" on agreements you never read. Hidden in that fine print are clauses that let companies:

• Sell your personal data to advertisers
• Force you into binding arbitration (goodbye, lawsuits)
• Auto-renew subscriptions without clear warning
• Terminate your account whenever they want
• Keep your data forever, even after you leave

**ProtectYaNeck reads the fine print so you don't have to.**

🔍 **HOW IT WORKS**

1. Browse normally — we detect agreement pages automatically
2. See instant risk analysis with color-coded severity
3. Read plain-English summaries of what you're agreeing to
